# Gestureness 

## Prerequisites

1) Tensorflow-0.11 <br/>
2) Tensorlayer (commit ba30379f1b86f930d6e86e1c8db49cbd2d9aa314) <br/> 
   git clone https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer.git <br/>
   git checkout ba30379f1b86f930d6e86e1c8db49cbd2d9aa314 <br/>
#### The original Tensorlayer does not support the convolutional LSTM, so the tensorlayer/layers.py needs to be replaced with tensorlayer-layers.py. <br/> <br/>

## How to use the code
### Prepare the data
1) Convert each video files into images using extract_frames.sh in the dataset_splits/video2image.tar.gz. Before running extract_frames.sh, you should change the ROOTDIR in extract_frames.sh, so that IsoGD_phase_1 and IsoGD_phase_2 do exist under $ROOTDIR.
2) Replace the path "/ssd/dataset" in the files under "dataset_splits" with the path "$ROOTDIR"
3) run check_files.py to make sure all necessary image files do exist

### Training Stage
1) Use training_*.py to finetune the networks for different modalities. Please change os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] according to your workstation. <br/>
2) You can run the three training_*.py on three TITAN X GPUs simultaneously. <br/>
